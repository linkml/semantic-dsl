    description: >-
      The type of grammar, e.g. regular, context-free, etc.
    permissible_values:
      ContextFree:
        description: >-
          A context-free grammar is a formal grammar in which every production rule has the form A → α, where A is a nonterminal and α is a string of terminals and nonterminals. The string α is called the right-hand side of the production rule, and A is called the left-hand side. The set of all nonterminals is called the set of variables. The set of all terminals is called the set of terminals. The set of all variables and terminals is called the alphabet of the grammar. The set of all strings of terminals and nonterminals that can be derived from the start symbol is called the language of the grammar.

      Regular:
        description: >-
            A regular grammar is a formal grammar in which every production rule has the form A → a, where A is a nonterminal and a is a terminal. The string a is called the right-hand side of the production rule, and A is called the left-hand side. The set of all nonterminals is called the set of variables. The set of all terminals is called the set of terminals. The set of all variables and terminals is called the alphabet of the grammar. The set of all strings of terminals and nonterminals that can be derived from the start symbol is called the language of the grammar.

      ContextSensitive:
        description: >-
          A context-sensitive grammar is a formal grammar in which every production rule has the form A → αB, where A and B are nonterminals and α is a string of terminals and nonterminals. The string α is called the right-hand side of the production rule, and A and B are called the left-hand side. The set of all nonterminals is called the set of variables. The set of all terminals is called the set of terminals. The set of all variables and terminals is called the alphabet of the grammar. The set of all strings of terminals and nonterminals that can be derived from the start symbol is called the language of the grammar.
